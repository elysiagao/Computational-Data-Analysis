# Computational-Data-Analysis
This is an ongoing project for the course Computational Data Analysis, masters course at Denmark Technical University. I am working on the following: 
•	Conducting an in-depth analysis and modeling project, aimed at predicting outcomes based on a given set of features
•	Utilizing and compared various regression and classification models, including KNN, linear regression, ridge regression, decision trees, random forest, gradient boosting, SVM, LDA, and Adaboost
•	Imputing missing values and handled categorical variables, using appropriate techniques to ensure high-quality data
•	Selecting the most suitable models based on evaluation metrics and validation methods, including information criteria and root mean squared error (RMSE)
•	Writing a concise report of the project's findings and supported choices of model, model selection, and validation with compelling arguments and clear explanations
